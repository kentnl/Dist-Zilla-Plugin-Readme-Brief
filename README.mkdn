# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Readme::Brief - Provide a short simple README with just the essentials

# VERSION

version 0.003000

# SYNOPSIS

    [Readme::Brief]
    ; Override autodetected install method
    installer = eumm
    ; Override autodetected main_module or main_module.pod as a source
    source_file = lib/Path/To/Module.pm

# DESCRIPTION

This provides a terse but informative README file for your CPAN distribution
that contains just the essential details about your dist a casual consumer would want to know.

- The name of the primary module in the distribution
- The distribution's main modules description
- Simple installation instructions from an extracted archive
- Short copyright information

# NOTE

This is still reasonably fresh code and reasonably experimental, and feature enhancements and bug fixes
are actively desired.

However, bugs are highly likely to be encountered, especially as there are no tests.

# MECHANICS

- Heading is derived from the `package` statement in the `source_file`
- Description is extracted as the entire `H1Nest` of the section titled `DESCRIPTION` in the `source_file`
- Installation instructions are automatically determined by the presence of either
    - A `Makefile.PL` file in your dist ( Where it assumes `EUMM` style )
    - A `Build.PL` file in your dist ( where it assumes `Module::Build` style )
    - In the case of both, only instructions for `Makefile.PL` will be emitted.
    - All of the above behavior can be overridden using the [`installer`](#installer) attribute.
- _ALL_ Copyright and license details are extracted from the `source_file` in any `H1Nest` that has either `COPYRIGHT` or `LICENSE` in the heading.
- Or failing such a section, a `COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE` section will be derived from `zilla->license`

# ATTRIBUTES

## source\_file

Determines the file that will be parsed for POD to populate the README from.

By default, it uses your `main_module`, except if you have a `.pod` file with
the same basename and path as your `main_module`, in which case it uses that.

## installer

Determines what installers to document in the `INSTALLATION` section.

By default, that section is determined based on the presence of certain
files in your `dist`.

However, in the event you have multiple installers supported, manually specifying
this attribute allows you to control which, or all, and the order.

    installer = eumm ; # only eumm

    installer = eumm
    installer = mb     ; EUMM shown first, MB shown second

    installer = mb
    installer = eumm   ; EUMM shown second, MB shown first

The verbiage however has not yet been cleaned up such that having both is completely lucid.

# SEE ALSO

Here are some competing modules and how this module differs from them.

- [`[Readme]`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Readme)

    Gives a much briefer more generic `README` file, which lacks quite as much readable content,
    and contains no installation instructions.

- [`[ReadmeFromPod]`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReadmeFromPod)

    Provides various output formats, but ultimately is a transformer of your `source_file`'s `POD`,
    which is excessive for some peoples tastes. ( And lacks install instructions )

- [`[ReadmeAnyFromPod]`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReadmeAnyFromPod)

    Based on the above provides a bunch of extra features, but is ultimately limited
    in similar ways with regards to install details and verbosity.

- [`[Pod2Readme]`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Pod2Readme)

    Possibly the most straight forward `POD` â†’ `README` translator, but limited like the above
    in that it is _only_ a `POD` translator, but lacks the install instructions aspect.

- [`[InstallGuide]`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InstallGuide)

    The polar opposite approach that only focuses on elaborate installation instructions in `INSTALL`,
    but lacks any of the `POD` and `COPYRIGHT` elements.
