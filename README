Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Readme::Brief

Here are some competing modules and how this module differs from them.

*   "[Readme]"

    Gives a much briefer more generic "README" file, which lacks quite
    as much readable content, and contains no installation instructions.

*   "[ReadmeFromPod]"

    Provides various output formats, but ultimately is a transformer of
    your "main_module"'s "POD", which is excessive for some peoples
    tastes. ( And lacks install instructions )

*   "[ReadmeAnyFromPod]"

    Based on the above provides a bunch of extra features, but is
    ultimately limited in similar ways with regards to install details
    and verbosity.

*   "[Pod2Readme]"

    Possibly the most straight forward "POD" → "README" translator, but
    limited like the above in that it is *only* a "POD" translator, but
    lacks the install instructions aspect.

*   "[InstallGuide]"

    The polar opposite approach that only focuses on elaborate
    installation instructions in "INSTALL", but lacks any of the "POD"
    and "COPYRIGHT" elements.
